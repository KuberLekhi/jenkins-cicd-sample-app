Jenkins CI/CD Sample App

This is a simple Node.js app to demonstrate a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

‚úÖ 1. Set Up Jenkins Pipeline with Webhook

Steps:

Create a Freestyle or Pipeline project in Jenkins.

Connect it to your GitHub repository via webhook.

‚úÖ 2. Install Dependencies on EC2 (One-Time Setup)

Steps:

Run the following commands on your EC2 instance only once:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
sudo npm install -g pm2

‚úÖ 3. Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

3.1 Set Workspace Directory

Run the following command to set your workspace directory:

/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/project

‚û°Ô∏è Replace "project" with the name of your Jenkins freestyle project.

3.2 Change Permissions (One-Time Setup)

Ensure Jenkins can run scripts properly by executing:

sudo chown -R ubuntu:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/workspace
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/lib/jenkins/workspace

‚úÖ 4. Write Build Steps in Jenkins Pipeline

Steps:

Add these commands in the Build Steps of your Jenkins Project:

cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/A

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install only production dependencies (optional)
npm install --only=prod

# Fix security vulnerabilities (optional)
npm audit fix --force

# Run tests before deployment (optional)
npm test

# If your app has a build step (optional)
npm run build

# Restart or start the application using PM2
pm2 restart myapp || pm2 start app.js --name myapp

# Save PM2 process list
pm2 save

‚úÖ 5. Make Sure the App Runs After Restart

5.1 Check PM2 Process

Run the following command to check if PM2 is managing the application:

pm2 list

5.2 Check Logs for Errors

To view logs and troubleshoot issues, use:

pm2 logs myapp

‚úÖ 6. Test the Webhook

Steps:

Make a change in GitHub, commit & push.

Jenkins should trigger automatically, pull new code, and restart the app.

‚úÖ 7. Access the Application

Steps:

Open the app in your browser:

http://EC2-PUBLIC-IP:3000

Important:

‚úîÔ∏è Ensure port 3000 is open in your EC2 security group.

This guide ensures your app runs smoothly with Jenkins, PM2, and GitHub webhooks! üöÄ
