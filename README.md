Jenkins CI/CD Sample App

This is a simple Node.js app to demonstrate a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

### Setup Instructions


âœ… 1. Set Up Jenkins Pipeline with Webhook

Create a Freestyle/Pipeline project in Jenkins.

Connect it to your GitHub repo via webhook.



âœ… 2. Install Dependencies on EC2 (Only once, not in every build)

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
sudo npm install -g pm2



âœ… 3. Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

Set Workspace Directory (/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/project).        (Replace project with the name of your freestyle project.)

Change permissions (one-time setup):
sudo chown -R ubuntu:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/workspace
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/lib/jenkins/workspace

This ensures Jenkins can run scripts properly.



âœ… 4. Write Build Steps in Jenkins Pipeline

Add these commands in Build Steps of Jenkins Project:

cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/A
npm install
pm install --only=prod  # Optional: Install only production dependencies
pm audit fix --force    # Optional: Fix security vulnerabilities
pm test                 # Optional: Run tests before deployment
pm run build            # Optional: If your app has a build step
pm2 restart myapp || pm2 start app.js --name myapp
pm2 save



âœ… 5. Make Sure App Runs After Restart

Check PM2 Process

pm2 list

Check Logs for Errors

pm2 logs myapp



âœ… 6. Test the Webhook

Make a change in GitHub, commit & push.

Jenkins should trigger automatically, pull new code, and restart the app.



âœ… 7. Access the Application

Open the app in a browser:

http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:3000

Ensure port 3000 is open in your EC2 security group.


This guide ensures your app runs smoothly with Jenkins, PM2, and GitHub webhooks! ðŸš€
